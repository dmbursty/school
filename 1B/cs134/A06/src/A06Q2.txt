Assignment 6, Question 2
  
(a) The implementation is incorrect because ...
  If the method is called with two positions that are only one apart, the code will enter an infinite loop.
  At the line with "int midpoint = (pos2-pos1+1)/2 + pos1;" if pos2-pos1 = 1, then (pos2-pos1+1)/2 = 1.
  On the next line, when the method is called again, it will be called with (a, pos1, pos1+1) and (a, pos1+2, pos2).
  The second call will return 0, since pos1+2 > pos2, and the first call will repeat the same process in an infinite loop.
  
  
(b) To fix the implementation, change the line 
    int midpoint = (pos2-pos1+1)/2 + pos1;
    to
    int midpoint = (pos2-pos1)/2 + pos1;
