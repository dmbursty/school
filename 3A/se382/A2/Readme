My L-System supports all of the required functionality including
-Step Button
-Reset Button
-Play/Pause Button
-MenuBar functionality
-Animation speed and step sliders
-Zooming functionality as follows

The zoom dropdown box has a number of preset values but can take user input, and is updated automatically when the user uses the mouse to zoom.

In order to use the mouse to zoom, the user only needs to drag a rectangle in the lsystem.  This zoom functionality is always present and user doesn't need to select a zoom tool.
