Assignment: 4 - Ray Tracer

The final executable was compiled on this machine: 
gl05.student.cs

How to invoke my program: 
./rt
OR
./rt_parallel  for parallelized version

Timing comparison:
Time to render nonhier.lua at 300x300 with supersampling at 15 rays per pixel:
Parallelized version - Average real time: 13.9s
+-----+-------+-------+-------+
|trial|   1   |   2   |   3   |
+-----+-------+-------+-------+
|real | 13.7s | 14.1s | 13.9s |
|user | 38.6s | 38.3s | 38.4s |
+-----+-------+-------+-------+

Regular version - Average real time: 37.9s
+-----+-------+-------+-------+
|trial|   1   |   2   |   3   |
+-----+-------+-------+-------+
|real | 38.4s | 37.2s | 38.1s |
|user | 38.1s | 36.7s | 37.6s |

How to use my extra features: 
The extra feature is antialiasing from jittered supersampling.  By default it is
on, and casts 15 rays per pixel.  The compiler flag -DANTIALIAS <NUM> can be
used to set the number of rays per pixel.
nonhier.png and nonhier_a.png show a render with and without antialiasing repectively.

My unique scene:
My unique scene features a barn constructed from hierarchical cubes and polygon
meshes, a UFO made from hierarchical spheres, and three of the provided macho
cows.  The UFO and barn make use of rotations, translates, and scales.  The UFO
is made to be shiny to show phong lighting.  A yellow light is placed beneath
the UFO to demonstrate coloured lights (see the corners of the barn), and
shadows.  Antialiasing is also enabled for the sample image.  The rest of the
objectives can easily be seen in the scene (gradient background, correct
layering).

I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
sample.lua         - Script for my unique scene
sample.png         - Final render of unique scene
nonhier.png        - Final render of non-hierarchical scene
nonhier_a.png      - Render of non-hierarchical scene with antialiasing OFF
macho-cows.png     - Final render of macho-cows
macho-cows-bb.png  - Macho-cows with special bounding box rendering
hier.png           - Final render of hierarchical scene

lua files for other scenes were provided and are in the data directory.

My program assumes the following: 
That you are running on a relatively fast computer.
