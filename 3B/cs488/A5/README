Assignment: 4 - Ray Tracer

The final executable was compiled on this machine: 
gl06.student.cs

How to invoke my program: 
./rt

I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
bounding_boxes.png        Shows hierarchical bounding boxes
bumpmaps.png              Shows bumpmaps
caustics_on_black.png     Shows caustics by themselves
caustics_on_wood.png      Shows same caustics in a scene
csg_donut.png             Shows CSG and texture mapping
csg.png                   Shows More CSG
csg_texture.png           Shows More CSG
final_photon.png       *  My final scene  *
final_scene.png           Alternate final scene
glossy1.png               Glossy reflections
glossy2.png               Glossier reflections
glossy_cone.png           Glossy plane reflections
macho_cows_test_box.png   Hierarchical bounding boxes
manns_room.png            Bonus image
new_primitives.png        New Primitives
no_caustics.png           Scene without caustics
nonhier.png               Refraction
textures.png              Texture Mapping
timings                   Hierarchical bounding box timing comparison - final scene
lua                       Lua files
maps                      Texture/bumpmap files


My program assumes the following: 
N/A

Objectives:
1. Additional primitives cylinder, cone, and torus are added.
2. Texture mapping is added.
3. Bump mapping is added.
4. Constructive solid geometry for primitives is added.
5. Glossy Reflections are added.
6. Refraction is added.
7. Hierarchical bounding boxes for improved efficiency.
8. Photon mapping with kD-trees.
9. Caustics using photon mapping.
10. A final scene is modelled as described above.
